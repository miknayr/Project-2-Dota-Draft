6/9 -5pm update;
-gotta build the team to display at the bottom? have to fix the grid
-kind of lost.


6/10 - 12pm update; 
- fixed /:id page to match with hero ID, so you can search for heroes specifically... maybe when you click into the hero for more detail???
- added a sequelize database, and seed files to get the heroes into a table... need to figure out many:many situation
- still no progress on creating an array that contains heroes based on hero_id.



6/10 - 5pm update; 
- not sure where to go, 
route pages need to be made for all the RESTful situation (confused)
a little lost on goals but also not sure how to achieve goals? vision isnt clear to begin with possibly.

added event click listener, similar to tic tac toe to add heroes into an array and make a state of "hero comp".
need to figure out how to move information from click to array as an element? maybe its an .then function???
