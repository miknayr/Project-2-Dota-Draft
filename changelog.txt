6/9 -5pm update;
-gotta build the team to display at the bottom? have to fix the grid
-kind of lost.


6/10 - 12pm update; 
- fixed /:id page to match with hero ID, so you can search for heroes specifically... maybe when you click into the hero for more detail???
- added a sequelize database, and seed files to get the heroes into a table... need to figure out many:many situation
- still no progress on creating an array that contains heroes based on hero_id.
