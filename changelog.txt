- still no progress on creating an array that contains heroes based on hero_id.



6/10 - 5pm update; 
- not sure where to go, 
route pages need to be made for all the RESTful situation (confused)
a little lost on goals but also not sure how to achieve goals? vision isnt clear to begin with possibly.

added event click listener, similar to tic tac toe to add heroes into an array and make a state of "hero comp".
need to figure out how to move information from click to array as an element? maybe its an .then function???
